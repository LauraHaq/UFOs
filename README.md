# UFOs

## Overview
Dana, a journalist and UFO enthusiast, would like to create a user friendly html page to allow the user to filter a large file by 
date, city, state, country, and/or shape of UFO sigthings. She would like the dynamic webpage to include her article, the table and the users' ability to filter through 
the data to instantly create a new table of sightings with filtered data. To accomplish this project a table was created using JavaScript and D3 language to build a 
table and then use basic html, bootstrap and css files to build the website. Dev Tools was also used to log the findings and to find any errors in the code for adjustments.

## Results
### Index
- html page before user adding filters:

- User able to type in date (shown here: 1/7/20210) and press enter:
![data_filterd](https://github.com/LauraHaq/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filterby_Date.png)

- User able to type in multiple filters:
![multiple_filtered](https://github.com/LauraHaq/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filterby_mutiple.png)


- Dev Tools log the user's input:

## Summary
My webpage was a success in filtering data to date, city, state, country and/or shape of UFO sighting to give the user the desired data. The webpage also included Dana's 
article and a format and image to create a clean, user friendly webpage. The drawbacks are that the filtering information enterd by the user has to be excact to the data
listed in the table to get results. For example, typing 01/07/2010 produces zero results but 1/7/2010 gives actual data. The user would have to type in exact matches 
as what is shown in the table to get results. If there were more time I would look into retrieving more sightings in addtional sources. This could give more validity to the 
results given here if there were more people seeing the same UFO sighting. The code I used here can be used again in JavaScipt data Files. Also, I would love to 
have provided examples of what was seen for the user with images. Their interest of what was seen as well as give examples of the "Shape" column would give more 
understanding such as what "light" means as a shape.
